<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I always wanted to make an IMC Calculator project, and this week i saw i big oportunity to make it. I want to have a control of my weight over the time i go to the gym, so i can look at my progress and also always know my IMC, so i made this project to help me with that. This project was one of the best project i did using javascript, because i learn so much and i finally start to worry about the code, so i make this project the more organization that i could, so it very easy to understand it.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can vew my progress over the time in the gym and also to learn more functions and reenforce my knologes in javascript.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>To use the project is simple, just add your height (remember to use a ",") and your weight, and then press the calculation botton. Once the user calculates his imc, a new div is going to show in the middle of the page with all the information. If the input value is wrong or if the user didnt add a valid number an error message will appear.</p>
